### What we look for

---

Empathy

Note:

Empathy is ability to share feelings of another
<p>
1. Empathy is the cornerstone of Pivotal culture - you can't build a team without
 it 
2. Understanding - Empathy helps us build products customers want & need 
3. Complexity without empathy is bad - when you write something mental remember
someone has to read/change it!

---

Communication

Note:
1. Get candidates to let their guard down, helps things flow. Be Nice!!
2. Find out what they're passionate about (can be non-technical)
3. Have them articulate a hard problem or situation. Could be code, architecture or a team issue.

---

Learning

Note:
1. Hiring for what candidates do not yet know is great - our world is changing. Avoids bias 
2. We do not need people who fear learning, who fear change 
3. Ask the question: What have you learned during the interview? This helps demonstrates learning ability
4. Breadth and depth

---

###So, what we look for:

1. Empathy
2. Communicators
3. Learners

Note:
1. Do not compromise
3. Passion, effectiveness, integrity, creativity
3. Are they impressive?

---

### What we avoid

---

Knowledge workers

Note:
1. A worker whose main capital is knowledge, they don't seek mobility
2. Little breadth 
3. Depends on the stage of the career of course!

---

Clones

Note: 
1. Different skills are important - it's how we all learn
3. Strong teams need blends of skills and experience to eliminate inherent bias. Diversity!
3. Solo vs Team based players

---

Arseholes

Note:
1. At lunch how to they treat waiters? With respect?
2. Are they self-serving? What questions do they ask?
3. Stuck in a lift principle

---

### So, what we avoid:

1. Knowledge workers (deep experts in a one thing)
2. Mirror images of ourselves
3. Assholes

---

### Feedback cycle...
